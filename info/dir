   Welcome to the GNU standalone Info program.  The documentation
presented here is part of the djgpp development package.

   To view a topic, use the arrow keys to position the cursor on one of
the lines beginning with a '*' and press 'm' and then 'Enter'.

   This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics.  Typing "d"
returns here, "q" exits, "?" lists all INFO commands, "h" gives a primer
for first-timers, "mTexinfo<Return>" visits Texinfo topic, etc.  To edit
this dir-file, edit 'dir.txi', and pass it through 'makeinfo'.
