ABOUT THE TEST-VECTOR GENERATORS

This directory contains the programs that generate the test vectors
that are used in the test environment.  Each program generates at
least two functions (float and double precision).  Output consists
of a file for each function covered whose name is <function>_vec.c.
In MSDOS, this name is shortened as needed to fit in the format of
an eight-character file name.

The principle code files for each of the generators consist of a *.cpp
file and a header file, genmathv.h.  The code for each generator is built
quite like each of its brethren:

    There are two generating subroutines - one generates test vectors
    for double precision functions, the other for float precision ones.
    Each generating subroutine does the following:

	1. Opens a disk file for output
	2. Writes the first two lines of the vector file
	3. Generates vectors, writes to disk

    The main function is located at the very bottom of each program
    file.

Most of the generators use functions in the extra-precision library to
produce base values.  The extra-precision functions, housed in directory
tests/cygnus/tgen/qfloat, are defined in header file qfloat.h.  This file
is a C++ wrapper file that defines inline functions for extra-precision
arithmetic.

To compile a generator, test.h and qfloat.h must be in their respective
directories and the extra-precision library, qfloatx.a, must be located
in the qfloat directory.  The makefile in this (the tgen) directory is
fairly straightforward.
