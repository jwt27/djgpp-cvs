TEST OF TANH(X) VS (TANH(X-1/8)+TANH(1/8))/(1+TANH(X-1/8)TANH(1/8))

   2000 RANDOM ARGUMENTS WERE TESTED FROM THE INTERVAL
      (     1.2500e-01,     5.4931e-01)


 TANH(X) WAS LARGER   146 TIMES,
             AGREED  1683 TIMES, AND
        WAS SMALLER   171 TIMES.

 THERE ARE  53 BASE   2 SIGNIFICANT DIGITS IN A FLOATING-POINT NUMBER

 THE MAXIMUM RELATIVE ERROR OF     2.1796e-16 =    2 ** -52.03
    OCCURRED FOR X =     2.604160e-01
 THE ESTIMATED LOSS OF BASE   2 SIGNIFICANT DIGITS IS   0.97


 THE ROOT MEAN SQUARE RELATIVE ERROR WAS     5.6762e-17 =    2 ** -53.97
 THE ESTIMATED LOSS OF BASE   2 SIGNIFICANT DIGITS IS   0.00

 TEST OF UNDERFLOW FOR VERY SMALL ARGUMENT.

       TANH(3.313893e-243) = 0.000000e+00
 THE FUNCTION TANH WILL BE CALLED WITH THE ARGUMENT 1.7976931e+308
       TANH(1.797693e+308) = 1.000000e+00
 THE FUNCTION TANH WILL BE CALLED WITH THE ARGUMENT 4.9406565e-324
