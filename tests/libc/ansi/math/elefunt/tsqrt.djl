TEST OF SQRT(X*X) - X


   2000 RANDOM ARGUMENTS WERE TESTED FROM THE INTERVAL
       (     7.0711e-01,     1.0000e+00)


 SQRT(X) WAS LARGER     0 TIMES,
             AGREED  2000 TIMES, AND
        WAS SMALLER     0 TIMES.


 THERE ARE  53 BASE   2 SIGNIFICANT DIGITS IN A FLOATING-POINT NUMBER


 THE MAXIMUM RELATIVE ERROR OF     0.0000e+00 =    2 **-999.00
    OCCURRED FOR X =     0.000000e+00
 THE ESTIMATED LOSS OF BASE   2 SIGNIFICANT DIGITS IS   0.00


 THE ROOT MEAN SQUARE RELATIVE ERROR WAS     0.0000e+00 =    2 **-999.00
 THE ESTIMATED LOSS OF BASE   2 SIGNIFICANT DIGITS IS   0.00

TEST OF SPECIAL ARGUMENTS


 SQRT(XMIN) = SQRT( 4.9406565e-324) =  2.2227587e-162


 SQRT(1-EPSNEG) = SQRT(1-  1.1102230e-16) =   1.0000000e+00


 SQRT(1.0) = SQRT(  1.0000000e+00) =   1.0000000e+00


 SQRT(1+EPS) = SQRT(1+  2.2204460e-16) =   1.0000000e+00


 SQRT(XMAX) = SQRT( 1.7976931e+308) =  1.3407808e+154


TEST OF ERROR RETURNS


 SQRT WILL BE CALLED WITH THE ARGUMENT      0.0000e+00
 THIS SHOULD NOT TRIGGER AN ERROR MESSAGE


 SQRT RETURNED THE VALUE      0.0000e+00



SQRT WILL BE CALLED WITH THE ARGUMENT     -1.0000e+00
 THIS SHOULD TRIGGER AN ERROR MESSAGE


 SQRT RETURNED THE VALUE             NaN



 THIS CONCLUDES THE TESTS
