SPECIAL TESTS

 IF  1.000000e+00 IS NOT ALMOST 1.0E0,    SIN HAS THE WRONG PERIOD.

 THE IDENTITY   SIN(-X) = -SIN(X)   WILL BE TESTED.

 TEST OF UNDERFLOW FOR VERY SMALL ARGUMENT.


       SIN(3.313893e-243) = 3.313893e-243
 THE FOLLOWING THREE LINES ILLUSTRATE THE LOSS IN SIGNIFICANCE
 FOR LARGE ARGUMENTS.  THE ARGUMENTS ARE CONSECUTIVE.

       SIN( 9.490627e+07) = 9.419571e-01

       SIN( 9.490627e+07) = 9.419571e-01

       SIN( 9.490627e+07) = 9.419570e-01
TEST OF ERROR RETURNS


 SIN WILL BE CALLED WITH THE ARGUMENT     9.0072e+15
 THIS SHOULD TRIGGER AN ERROR MESSAGE


 SIN RETURNED THE VALUE    -8.4893e-01
