SPECIAL TESTS


 THE IDENTITY  ALOG(X) = -ALOG(1/X)  WILL BE TESTED.

        X         F(X) + F(1/X)

 TEST OF SPECIAL ARGUMENTS


 ALOG(1.0) =   0.0000000e+00


 ALOG(XMIN) = ALOG( 4.9406565e-324) =  -7.4444007e+02


 ALOG(XMAX) = ALOG( 1.7976931e+308) =   7.0978271e+02


TEST OF ERROR RETURNS


 ALOG WILL BE CALLED WITH THE ARGUMENT    -2.0000e+00
 THIS SHOULD TRIGGER AN ERROR MESSAGE


 ALOG RETURNED THE VALUE            NaN


 ALOG WILL BE CALLED WITH THE ARGUMENT     0.0000e+00
 THIS SHOULD TRIGGER AN ERROR MESSAGE


 ALOG RETURNED THE VALUE           -Inf



 THIS CONCLUDES THE TESTS
