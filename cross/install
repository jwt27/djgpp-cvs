               Building a cross compiler based on DGJPP


1.  GCC is kinda touchy about the text files in the distribution being
    UNIX text files rather than DOS text files.  YOU MUST USE "unzip -a"
    rather than "unzip" to unpack the distribution.  If you havn't,
    YOU MUST delete the directory and start again.
    

2.  Download gcc and binutils from your favorite gnu archive, perhaps

        ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gcc-2.7.2.tar.gz
        ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/binutils-2.7.tar.gz
        
        
3.  Unpack gcc and binutils in the current directory

        gzip -c gcc-2.7.2.tar.gz | tar -xf -
        gzip -c binutils-2.7.tar.gz | tar -xf -

    
4.  Edit the makefile.  You will AT LEAST need to set the prefix
    to determine where the cross compiler will be stored.
    
5.  Apply the patch "patch.lib" found in the current directory

        patch < patch.lib
        
            
6.  Build the cross compiler:

        make all

    
7.  Install the cross compiler:

        make install
