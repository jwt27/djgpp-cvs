# We use POSIX-style signedness in the names and output,
# internal-style signedness in the specifications.
# For example, TZ=Etc/GMT+4 corresponds to 4 hours _behind_ GMT;
# it is equivalent to TZ=GMT+4, which is implemented directly as per POSIX.

# Earlier incarnations of this package were not POSIX-compliant,
# and had lines such as
#		Zone	GMT-12		-12	-	GMT-1200
# We did not want things to change quietly if someone accustomed to the old
# way does a
#		zic -l GMT-12
# so we moved the names into the Etc subdirectory.
