# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1995-12-19):
#
# A good source for time zone historical data outside the U.S. is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The International Atlas (3rd edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
# Except where otherwise noted, it is the source for the data below.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and the discovery of the longitude,
# Oxford University Press (1980).
#
# I invented the abbreviations marked `*' in the following table;
# the rest are from earlier versions of this file, or from other sources.

# From Paul Eggert (1996-05-04):
# Shanks has Yerevan switching to 3:00 (with Russian DST) in spring 1991,
# but usno1995 has Armenia at 4:00 (with DST), and Edgar Der-Danieliantz
# <edd@AIC.NET> reported today that Yerevan probably won't use DST this year,
# though it did use DST in 1995.  We guess Yerevan stayed in sync with Moscow
# between 1990 and 1995, but stopped using DST in 1996.
# Der-Danieliantz also asked for a better abbreviation than `YSK'
# after independence.  Apparently no abbreviation is in common use;
# use `AMST/AMDT' since `AM' is the ISO country code for Armenia.

# People's Republic of China

# From Guy Harris:
# People's Republic of China.  Yes, they really have only one time zone.

# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# No they don't.  See TIME mag, February 17, 1986 p.52.  Even though
# China is across 4 physical time zones, before Feb 1, 1986 only the
# Peking (Bejing) time zone was recognized.  Since that date, China
# has two of 'em -- Peking's and Urumqi (named after the capital of
# the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region).  I don't know about DST for it.
#
# . . .I just deleted the DST table and this editor makes it too
# painful to suck in another copy..  So, here is what I have for
# DST start/end dates for Peking's time zone (info from AP):
#
#     1986 May 4 - Sept 14
#     1987 mid-April - ??

# From U. S. Naval Observatory (January 19, 1989):
# CHINA               8 H  AHEAD OF UTC  ALL OF CHINA, INCL TAIWAN
# CHINA               9 H  AHEAD OF UTC  APR 17 - SEP 10

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1995-12-19):
# Shanks writes that China switched from the Chinese calendar on 1912 Feb 12.
# He also writes that China has had a single time zone since 1980 May 1,
# observing summer DST from 1986 through 1991; this contradicts Devine's
# note about Time magazine, though apparently _something_ happened in 1986.
# Go with Shanks for now.  I made up names for the other pre-1980 time zones.

# We have no details, but we'll guess they didn't move the clocks back in fall.

# From Paul Eggert (1995-11-13):
# usno1995 has Georgia at 4:00.  Guess that Georgia stopped transitions

# From Ephraim Silverberg (1996-01-02):
#
# According to the Office of the Secretary General of the Ministry of
# Interior, there is NO set rule for Daylight-Savings/Standard time changes.
# Each year they decide anew what havoc to wreak on the country.  However,
# there is a "supposed" set of rules which is subject to change depending
# on the party the Minister of Interior, the size of the coalition
# government, the phase of the moon and the direction of the wind.  Hence,
# changes may need to be made on a semi-annual basis.  One thing is entrenched
# in law, however: that there must be at least 150 days of daylight savings
# time annually.  Ever since 1993, the change to daylight savings time has
# been from midnight Thursday night to 1 a.m. Friday morning and the change
# back to standard time on Saturday night from midnight daylight savings time
# to 11 p.m. standard time.  1996 is an exception to this rule where the
# change back to standard time takes place on Sunday night instead of Saturday
# night to avoid conflicts with the Jewish New Year.

# on August 31, 1995, by the previous Minister of Interior.  The new Minister
# of Interior changed the dates on January 1, 1996, to take into account the
# desires of certain portions of Israeli society (the next election is in the
# Fall of 1996).  After this (1996) year's Daylight Savings Time is over, the
# new minister has announced that a study will be conducted as to the wishes of
# the populace regarding the length of Daylight Savings Time and the Interior
# Committee will meet to review the results of the study and make any necessary
# changes to the 1997-1998 dates.  Never a dull moment in the State of Israel.

# `9:00' and `JST' is from Guy Harris.

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1995-03-06):
# Today's _Asahi Evening News_ (page 4) reports that Japan had
# daylight saving between 1948 and 1951, but ``the system was discontinued
# because the public believed it would lead to longer working hours.''
# Shanks writes that daylight saving in Japan during those years was as follows:

# but the only locations using it were US military bases.
# We go with Shanks and omit daylight saving in those years for Asia/Tokyo.
