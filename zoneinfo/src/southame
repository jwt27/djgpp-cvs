# A good source for time zone historical data outside the U.S. is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The International Atlas (3rd edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).

# I invented the abbreviations marked `*' in the following table;
# the rest are from earlier versions of this file, or from other sources.
# Some of these are just plausible excuses for common English abbreviations.

# listed here do not observe DST, according to the OAG.  Time zone names
# are pure inventions, and none are supplied for countries not observing
# DST; updates from natives would be appreciated.  The times that DST
# starts and ends are based on the assumption that they switch a 2AM just
# as everybody else does.

# Argentina

# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# Argentina: first Sunday in October to first Sunday in April since 1976.
# Double Summer time from 1969 to 1974.  Switches at midnight.

# From U. S. Naval Observatory (January 19, 19889):
# ARGENTINA           3 H BEHIND   UTC

# From Hernan G. Otero <hernan@isoft.com.ar> (June 26, 1995):
# I am sending modifications to the Argentinian time zone table...
# AR was chosen because they are the ISO letters that represent Argentina.

# From Guy Harris:
# The OAG lists October 25, 1987 and February 12, 1988 as the starting and

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (November 18, 1993):
# The mayor of Rio recently attempted to change the time zone rules
# just in his city, in order to leave more summer time for the tourist trade.
# The rule change lasted only part of the day;
# the federal government refused to follow the city's rules, and business
# was in a chaos, so the mayor backed down that afternoon.
# Shanks claims Acre stopped observing DST after 1988 Feb 7, but it
# could just be that his table ran out of room.  We're extrapolating
# about time zone changes after 1990 Feb 11.
