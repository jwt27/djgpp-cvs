# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1995-11-03)
#
# The Web has several other sources for time zone and daylight savings data.
# Here are some recent links that may be of interest.
#
# Date and Time Gateway
#	http://www.bsdi.com/date
# A text-based source for tables of current time throughout the world.
# Its point-and-click interface accesses a recent version of the tz data.
#
# Local Times Around the World
#	http://www.hilink.com.au/times/
# This text-based system contains links to local time servers
# throughout the world, and though the coverage is limited,
# the live data provide a nice way to check one's tables.
#
# World Time Zones
#	http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/tzones.html
# US Naval Observatory data, used as the source for `usno1995'.
#
# Standard Time Zones of the World

#	http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/95fact/802389h.gif	[1317 kB]
# A static time zone map, available in both low-resolution and
# high-resolution versions. The quality is good, but the map does not
# indicate summer time, and parts of the data are a few years out of date.
#
# VIBE's World Map
#	http://pathfinder.com/vibe/vibeworld
# An active time zone map. You can point to the map and find out what
# time it is at that location. The map and data are not as good as
# other sources.

# To Paul's list of time zone information on the web, I would add the
# following URL:
#	http://www.dhl.com/dhl/dhlinfo/1bb.html
# or more simply:
#	http://www.dhl.com/
# 
# This is run by DHL (the courier company), and it presents a list of the  
# countries served by that company.  If you then click on a particular  
# country, here's an example of what you'll see (graphics stripped out):
# 
# United Kingdom
# 
# HOLIDAYS: Jan 1, 2, Apr 14, 17, May 1, 29, Aug 28, Dec 25, 26
# 
# INTERNATIONAL DIALING CODE: +44
# 
# CURRENT LOCAL TIME: 09:41 Monday 6 November 1995
# 
# I find this rather handy, and given that DHL covers 217 countries and  
# territories, it's pretty comprehensive coverage.
# 
# (I have no idea what system DHL is using to calculate the local time, but  
# it's been accurate so far.)
